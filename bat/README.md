# start_t7_uem.bat

## Context: 
I turned a menial 1-second task into a 4+ hour-long batch adventure. I wanted to run one thing and have UEM run alongside the t7patch. 
To get around Steam's warning popup for attempting to launch a game exe with parameters, I had to run the Steam exe with certain arguments to make it run the game with UEM.

## How to use:
This file should either be run from inside your **t7patch** folder (the bat file should be "next to" wherever the t7patch exe is), or you can optionally pass the bat your t7patch exe file path for it to load (in double quotes please). 
The game loads through registry magic.

ex."C:\Path\To\Bat\File\start_t7_uem.bat" "C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads\t7patch\t7patch_2.03.exe"

## Arguments:
- Path to your t7patch exe (defaults to the same directory

## Requires:
- [UEM](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2942053577)
- [t7patch](https://github.com/shiversoftdev/t7patch)
